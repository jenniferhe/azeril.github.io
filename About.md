## Mission

I am a self-motivated content creator focusing on digital art(especially with data), traditional China culture and intentional Living. I create via code, writing and media production.

## My Story

My name is Jenn (简), short for Jennifer. It was a random name that came up to my mind when I first stepped on to the land of the United States in 2013. It sounds exactly the same as the Chinese word 简, which means simple, or to simplify. As my life unfolds, I appreciate this name more and more because it is like a prophet and a constant reminder for me in every aspect of my life in every moment. I practice 简 by shedding away out-of-date dust, welcoming new ideas and creating with passion. In short, 简 is my living philosophy. As a data scientist and digital artist who face tons of data/content online, I am inspired to intentionally select, build and present art pieces using my technical skills and artistic talent to inspire people. As a content creator, I present my living philosophy on multiple media in Chinese and English.

I am born and raised in Luoyang, China, an ancient town with more than 1000-year history, the origin of Chinese civilization. Growing up immersing in Chinese traditional culture such as Calligraphy, tea ceremony, Chinese Medicine and traditional Mahayana Buddhism, I was so accustomed to them thus I paid no attention. Instead, I treasure western culture and pure logical mindset. After ten year of pursuing the technology field, academic field in the United States, I was all tense up and finally took a break to visit my old hometown. I restarted visiting temple, meditating, practicing tea ceremony, writing calligraphy, and growing Chinese herb medicine. Those practices reminded me of myself, led me through the darkness and presented me with my life mission. That is, I am going to be the bridge that connect my mind and heart, connect individual and community, connect Chinese tradition with western technology.
