Ehhhh...I know it's not a good question.

My Name is Jennifer. Besides being programmer, I am also a purposeful traveller, photographer, sports fun and bookaholic.

I have traveled to countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. I enjoy immersing myself into different culture, experiencing novelty and capturing meaningful moments rather than just visiting the “must go attractions”

I love basketball, table tennis, marathon, skiing, and rock climbing. 
I love to read and my favorite book is One Hundred Years of Solitude.
